# Human_Following_robo
This project is an IoT-based autonomous human-following robot designed to track and follow a person using infrared (IR) sensors and motor control. The robot is built around an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which processes input signals from IR sensors that detect the movement and direction of a human.
